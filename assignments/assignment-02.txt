Reading:

In this assignment, we start looking at the features of the programming
language defined by the bash interpreter, its overall syntax and at what
bash does for each command line.

Chapter 3 enumerates these features, starting with an examination of the
syntax of bash (3.1), commands in bash (3.2), functions (3.3), parameters
(3.4), expansions (3.5), redirections (3.6), executing commands (3.7) and
shell scripts (3.8).

In this reading assignment, is included the introductory comments to chapter
3, and its first section (3.1) on the syntax of bash, including its read-
eval-pprint loop (its operation), shell quoting rules, and comments.
