# bash-course
repo for keeping track of assignments for learning bash

An in-depth beginner's course in bash, how it can be used day-to-day,
and how it can be used to automate the tedious things.

I'll add materials, and, for now the text we'll be using is the Bash
Reference, which is contained in the bash source, in a texinfo file.
I found a web site with this document on it, and the url for it is:

  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/index.html

you can also get a pdf of the bash manual, by browsing to this URL:

  https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/

and clicking on the link that says:

  PDF file (784K bytes).

and downloading that file.

We will be using this text for the course.

and, we're trying to use the ##linux-beginners channel on freenode.net.
Come join us if you can.

Good luck, and let's have some fun!
